## User Story
***
Hi! I'm Marie!
<br>
 
 I am currently a fullstack web Development student at UCD. I have and still are, adding projects to my profile on a regular basis. I also have my UX/UI certification from Coursera in both Figma and Adobe. I am also pursuing my I.T certification at the same time. I have experience in photography, photo editing, photo restoration, Graphic Arts and oh yea woodworking. I know that's quite a combo, but I love to challenge myself and expand my horizons. With all that I have learned and am still learning, I have found that I truly enjoy design.
 <br> 
## As a full stack student:
*I would like a page to showcase my skill set and completed projects*
